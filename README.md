# GENX flux calculations

Repo for calculating GHG fluxes from GENX chambers.

Contact: Abby Lewis

## Getting started

`L1.csv` provides the most recent QAQC-ed flux data.

To run these calculations yourself, you can use `Calculate and QAQC fluxes.Rmd`, which sources helper scripts in `./R`.

For fluxes that have not undergone QAQC, you can use `./processed_data/L0.csv`.
