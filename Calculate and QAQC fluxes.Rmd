This is a high-level script for generating and QAQCing fluxes. Functionally identical to R/generate_L1_fluxes.R, but designed to be a little more user-friendly.

USER INPUT HERE

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Whether you are a new user or your dropbox authentication is already complete
new_user <- TRUE 
# Whether you want to reprocess all flux calculations or just new data
reprocess <- FALSE 
#Folder containing downloaded LGR data
flux_folder <- here::here("Raw_data","dropbox_downloads") 
```

Run all calculations

```{r}
# load functions/packages 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
source(here::here("R","qaqc.R"))
source(here::here("R","download_new_data.R"))
source(here::here("R","calculate_flux.R"))
library(tidyverse)

#Check for new data and download locally
drop_auth(new_user = T)
download <- download_new_data(lgr_folder = here::here("Raw_data","dropbox_downloads"))

#Calculate fluxes, generating the L0 file
if(reprocess){
  L0 <- calculate_flux(start_date = "2021-01-01", 
                       end_date = Sys.Date()+1,
                       modif_start_date = NULL,
                       reprocess = reprocess)
} else {
  L0 <- calculate_flux()
}

#QAQC, generating the L1 file
data <- qaqc(here::here("processed_data","L0.csv"))
```
